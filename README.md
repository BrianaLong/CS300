CS300 data analysis and design

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
  The problem, being solved is using a data search set to sort course listing with their prerequisite. 

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
  In order to approach this problem a choice was made to determine which sorting method was best for the data set. I chose the Binary tree search as it had the shortest search time method. Data structures are important to understand because they help create an efficient way to design algorithms and search through them.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
  I often found myself having to look over my notes of the different sorting algorithms to make sure I was not only coding but also implementing them correctly.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
  My work on this project has expanded my knowledge of data structures. Before this course, I had rarely included them in my code. 

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  I believe the structure of my code has improved with this project. I also feel that being able to use sorting algorithms has allowed me to see how retrevial processes can be quicker compared to previous programs.
